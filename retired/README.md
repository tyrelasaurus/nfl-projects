# Retired Artifacts

Use this folder to store deprecated or superseded scripts and documents.

Guidelines:
- Move only files that are no longer used by any runner, backtest, or calibration.
- Reference the replacement tool or documentation in a short note.
- Do not move generated artifacts (CSV/HTML) â€” they are ignored via .gitignore.

Examples of candidates:
- Old analysis scripts replaced by backtest_winners_multi or calibration tools.
- Draft documentation replaced by docs/implementation_recommendation_plan.md.
