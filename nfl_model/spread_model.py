    NFL point spread prediction engine implementing Billy Walters methodology.
    
    This calculator transforms power rankings into point spread predictions using
    the proven Billy Walters approach, which emphasizes power rating differentials
    with home field advantage adjustments.
    
    Core Formula:
        Spread = (Home_Power - Away_Power) + Home_Field_Advantage
        
    Key Principles:
    - Negative spreads indicate home team favored (e.g., -7.0 = home team by 7)
    - Positive spreads indicate away team favored (e.g., +3.5 = away team by 3.5)
    - Power ratings should be normalized to Â±15 range for realistic spreads
    - Home field advantage typically ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 points
    
    Statistical Validation:
    The model targets >52.4% against-the-spread accuracy, which represents
    break-even performance accounting for standard sportsbook juice (-110).
    
    Attributes:
        home_field_advantage (float): Points added for home team advantage
        config: Configuration manager with model parameters
        
    Example:
        >>> calculator = SpreadCalculator(home_field_advantage=2.5)
        >>> spread = calculator.calculate_spread("KC", "BUF", power_rankings)
        >>> print(f"Spread: KC {spread:+.1f}")  # e.g., "Spread: KC -3.5"

        The home field advantage represents the average point differential

        - Crowd noise and energy
        - Travel fatigue for away team  
        - Referee bias tendencies
        - Familiarity with venue conditions
        
        Typical NFL home field advantages by venue type:
        - Outdoor stadiums: 2.0-2.5 points
        - Dome stadiums: 1.5-2.0 points  
        - High-altitude venues (Denver): 3.0+ points
